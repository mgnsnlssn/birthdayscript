# birthdayscript
A birthday script for info TV @ school
Idea: Use a webpage and a script to show who has his/her birthday. Pull data from Schoolsoft and put it together using a script on a webpage.

Todo: Edit script, so it takes an external textfile and read from, easier update on students. 

Template Excel file is my way of exporting students and staff from Schoolsoft, making the data directly from one sheet to another.
index.html is the file used to run the script.
